''' Pick 5 of these words and review the explanation for how it is used as a keyword in
Python. Add these 5 definitions as comments to your exercise document. Put ^^
around any terms that you are not familiar with '''

'''A lambda function in Python is an ^^anonymous function^^. It can take any number of arguments but only have a single expression.

The yield function ends a function and returns an ^^iterator.^^

Accessing a global variable is simple as any other variable but to modify a global variable, you need to use the ^^global keyword.^^

The finally statement is an optional part of ^^try… except error^^. It always executes the code regardless of whether an error was thrown or not.

The try statement is used to make a ^^try… except statement^^. The try statement starts a block of code that is tried to execute. If it fails, the except block catches the error.'''
